    "Currently, signing a new soccer player is based a lot on name recognition, goal scoring percentile, and sometimes just hype. Building a team around world class players is what everyone wants but sometimes, even world class players have to adjust to a new position if their natural position is already filled by another superstar. The likes of Messi, Suarez, and Griezmann are all superstars but have difficulty building chemistry in the attacking third of the pitch. This is partly because Griezman needs to adapt to a wider position than he was used to naturally playing at his former club. At his former club, Griezman would be the focal point of attack and now at Barcelona, he's not. Instead he is playing on the wing or as a striker when Luis Suarez is injured. \n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't just limited to Griezman but other soccer players as well. Hirving Lozano is currently Napoli's most expensive signing at $\\$46.5$ million dollars. Pundits in Italy have been harsh critics about this transfer since he hasn't been able to make an impact like he did at his former club. We can also look at Neymar's record \\$263 million transfer fee to PSG. He hasn't been able to make an impact on his team's performance overall. Neymar's case might be a bit different because there are problems unrelated to his football abilities that have hindered his performance but the point is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we, as a club manager or owner know that a player will be a great addition to their team? Just because players have great talent doesn't necessarily make them the perfect fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Barcelona's case, if someone else who was naturally playing as a Left Winger would come in to replace Neymar, there wouldn't be a need to put so much pressure on Griezman to quickly adapt to a new role this isn't his natural role. He can still do the job well but he isn't as efficient as he was at his former club. It is frustrating to see a player like Griezman valued at $135 million not produce the results that are expected of him, from a club manager's perspective. Equally important, the player feels frustrated in not being about to produce similar results and will take longer to adaptat. The longer the adaptation period, the more impatient the fans, pundits, club owners, and even the player themself will get. The player's need for time to adapt to a new role, and the manager's need to see positive results as soon as possible are a difficult balance. "

    "Statsbomb has a public repo that is periodically updated with public event data for particular soccer matches that they release. The data I was working with initially consisted of 2.27 million rows once it was aggregated together. This was a lot of data to handle given the time constraints and data cleaning that needed to happen before even analyzing data. Upon reevaluation, I decided to focus on Barcelona's team since approximately 875k rows were pertaining to Barcelona games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning consisted of unpacking information stored as python dictionary equivalents within the json files. Some data contained nested dictionaries and data wrangling became much of the time consuming portion of the project. Functions were created in order to automate the process. However, the overall cleaning process was limited to Barcelona data due to the limited processing power of my computer and time constraints. Additionally, we narrowed down to the basic test cases for each Starting-XI players in a given Barcelona match. This serves as a proof of concept and the process becomes smoother when scaling up to larger quantities of matches per player and overall data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, GIFs were created in order for us to see player activity density every 5 minutes per game. When scaling to include the activity density for a player across a whole season, the \"natural\" position of that player will be revealed. This is because one game is not enough of a sample size to determine a player's natural position. A player can be playing a different position in the next game due to another player's injury or a tactical experiment. Over the course of the season, we are able to determine what postions were played effectivly and consistently based on heatmap image intensity. \n"
